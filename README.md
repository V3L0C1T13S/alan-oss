# Al-An OSS
Open source version of Al-An.ts

## Why another version of Al-An?
The proprietary version of Al-An has an AI heavily integrated into it, and a very powerful one at that. I originally decided to integrate it heavily into the bot in hopes of making a premium tier that would allow access to more powerful features of its AI (eg. server moderation, raid prevention, suspicious activity flagging), but this never came to be.

Either way, it's an extremely dangerous move to release publicly. The last thing we want is for Skynet to become real.

## What will happen to Al-An.ts?
Al-An.ts (Discord/Revolt bot) will be discontinued.

## What's the difference between this version and the old (proprietary) version?
This version has no AI capabilities, and uses a new plugin format that allows for easier abstraction across different services, interaction types, and more.

This version also uses [Reflectcord](https://github.com/V3L0C1T13S/reflectcord) for [Revolt](https://github.com/revoltchat) compatability instead of [Reject.js](https://github.com/revoltrejectorg/reject.js), which will be deprecated in favor of Reflectcord soon.
